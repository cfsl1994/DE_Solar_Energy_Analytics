# DE_Solar_Energy_Analytics

This lab project adapted in AWS, GCP and Azure include dataset includes internal data on a small Dutch solar panel company's installations and total energy capacity per region, as well as external public datasets from Statistics Netherlands (CBS) on similar metrics. The data pipeline begins with setting up a structured storage environment, organizing raw, transformed, and curated data. Raw internal and external datasets are then ingested into this environment. Schema definitions and cataloging ensure the datasets are well-organized and accessible. No-code tools are used for data preparation and transformation, cleaning and normalizing the data for analysis. Finally, querying and visualization tools extract insights and create interactive dashboards, allowing the company to evaluate its performance against official statistics. This solution is based on https://aws.amazon.com/es/blogs/big-data/enrich-datasets-for-descriptive-analytics-with-aws-glue-databrew/
